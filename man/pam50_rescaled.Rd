\title{Get pam50 predictions with ER status rescaling
This method requires a mixed ER+/ER- cohort. Rescaling is performed to match
the ER+ proportion in the UNC cohort.}
\usage{
pam50_rescaled(
  x,
  er_status,
  n_iter = 1000,

\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric matrix with expression values}

\item{er_status}{Logical vector indicating ER positivity. NAs are treated as
Unknown or Indeterminate status}

\item{n_iter}{Number of iterations for sampling}

\item{seed}{Random seed}

\item{cores}{Number of cores for parallel processing}
}
\value{
Data frame with PAM50 predictions for each sample and its corresponding subtype correlations
}
